# React Static - Algolia Example

This example is based on the basic version of React Static, but implements a simple Algolia search.

Included basic React Static features:

* Babel
* CSS imports
* Image imports
* File imports
* Automatic routing

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `algolia` template.

To make the search work you'll need to do the following:

* Add your Algolia `applicationID` & `adminApiKey` to `algolia.js`
* Add your `applicationID` & `searchOnlyApiKey` to `Search.js` container

Algolia CSS styles are `@import`ed in `app.css`.
