# React Static - Material UI with JSS

> [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) is a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design.

This example uses JSS server-side rendering capabilities.

To edit Material UI theme variables, use `src/theme.js`. To overwrite Material UI styling please refer to the [Material UI documentation](https://material-ui.com/customization/overrides/).

This example includes:
- General JSS support
- Material UI components and icons
- Google's Roboto font loaded from CDN
- Image imports
- File imports
- Automatic routing

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `material-ui` template.
