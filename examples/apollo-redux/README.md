# React Static - Apollo and Redux Example

This example is based on the most basic version of React Static available, and adds:

- React Apollo
- React Redux

Both libraries are now loosely coupled so it is very easy to use only one of them, just remove the code you do not want.

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `apollo-redux` template.
