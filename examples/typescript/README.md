# React Static - TypeScript Example

This example includes:
- TypeScript and loader configuration (full support)
- Source maps for everything (in dev)
- TypeScript paths alias mapping as a standard `webpack.config.js` used
within React Static's build system (see `tsconfig.json` paths and
`src/path-alias-example`)
- TypeScript hot module replacement
- Simultaneous support for **using JavaScript and TypeScript interchangeably**
- Types for all modules (except React Static's custom methods â€” will be
added later)
- Image imports
- File imports
- Automatic routing

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `typescript`
template.
