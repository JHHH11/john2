# React Static - Basic Prismic Example

This example includes tweaks to use React Static to with Prismic headless CMS. It includes:
- Babel
- CSS imports
- Image imports
- File imports
- Automatic routing
- Fetching data from [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `basic-prismic` template.

This is a very simplistic example which shows how to configure the Prismic JavaScript library to fetch some data.
