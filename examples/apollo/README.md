# React Static - Apollo Example

This example is based on the most basic version of React Static available, and adds:

- React Apollo

Apollo is only used at run time on the client side. Components are statically rendered in the "loading" state. They then load the query result on the client side.

To get started, run `react-static create` and use the `apollo` template.
