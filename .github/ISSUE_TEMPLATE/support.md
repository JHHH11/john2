# Stop!

React Static does not use issues to track support requests.

However, we invite you to visit our official support community at spectrum.chat/react-static!

There, you can see existing discussions (which will likely solve your problem!) or ask a new question to the community. Yay!

NOTE: If a support issue is opened, it will be automatically closed and redirected to the support community above. If you believe your problem warrants an bug report or feature request, please use a different template. Thanks!
